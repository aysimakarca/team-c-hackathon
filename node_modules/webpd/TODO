- Reorganize code (no files with 1000 lines)
- instead of checking all the time for pdGlob.isStarted, better checking for this._started
    i.e. all objects should have a _started state. Probably then 'start' and 'stop' hook should be changed to 'started' and 'stopped' ; 'start' and 'stop' handling the value of `_started` 
- bug webpd-test (subpatches)
