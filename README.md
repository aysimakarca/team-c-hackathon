# Hackathon Project of Team C


The artwork developed for this submission is based around a combination of a repeating sequence of notes and free running, pitch modulated sine waves. This is connected to a graphical generator taking the numerical audio frequency values as input which then visually represent the sounds. All programming is done in PD.

Conceptually, the artwork represents the constantly evolving nature of creative computing. 

For running the PD patch in a browser the WebPd application (https://github.com/sebpiq/WebPd) was utilized.
